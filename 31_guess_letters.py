"""
For this exercise, write the logic that asks a player to guess a letter and
displays letters in the clue word that were guessed correctly.
For now, let the player guess an infinite number of times until they get the entire word.
As a bonus, keep track of the letters the player guessed and
display a different message if the player tries to guess that letter again.
Remember to stop the game when all the letters have been guessed correctly!
Donâ€™t worry about choosing a word randomly or keeping track of the number of guesses the player has remaining
